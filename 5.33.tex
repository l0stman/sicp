The following piece of code in the compiled version of \lstinline!factorial!
\begin{lstlisting}
(assign val (op lookup-variable-value)
            (const n)
            (reg env))
(assign argl (op list) (reg val))
(save argl)
(assign proc (op lookup-variable-value)
             (const factorial)
             (reg env))
\end{lstlisting}

is replaced by the following code in the compiled version of
\lstinline!factorial-alt!:
\begin{lstlisting}
(save env)
(assign proc (op lookup-variable-value)
             (const factorial-alt)
             (reg env))
\end{lstlisting}

And later on, the piece of code
\begin{lstlisting}
(restore argl)
\end{lstlisting}

is replaced by

\begin{lstlisting}
(assign argl (op list) (reg val))
(restore env)
(assign val (op lookup-variable-value)
            (const n)
            (reg env))
\end{lstlisting}

These changes are just due to the fact that the order of the operands
to \lstinline!*! are reversed in the two functions.  Given that the
two samples code have exactly the same number of assignments, save and
restore operations, they have the same running time.
