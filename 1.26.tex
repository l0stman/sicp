\begin{document}
Each term \lstinline!(expmod base (/ exp 2))! is computed separately.
So if we note $T(exp)$ the time to execute \lstinline!expmod! we have,
\[ T(exp) = 2 T(exp/2) + \Theta(1).\]
And we can deduce easily that
\[ T(exp) = \Theta(exp).\]
The reasonning holds for the space's order of growth.
