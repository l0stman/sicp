The procedure is immediately run to add the current action to the
agenda \lstinline!the-agenda!.  The procedure added to the actions of a
wire affects only future events, not the current one.

For example, if \lstinline!accept-action-procedure! had been defined
as
\begin{lstlisting}
(define (accept-action-procedure! proc)
  (set! action-procedures
        (cons proc action-procedures)))
\end{lstlisting}
If we run \lstinline!propagate!, there's no change in the values of
the four wires.  Whereas in the first case, the value of the signal e
would become $1$.
