With an interpreter that uses application-order evalution, the
procedure won't terminate.  This is because the interpreter tries to
evaluate the operands and especially (p).

On the other hand, if the interpreter uses normal-order
evaluation, it returns 0.  The order of the evalution is as follows:
-> (test 0 (p))
-> (if (= 0 0)
	0
	(p))
-> 0
