If there's $n$ expressions in the sequence and note $p_1, p_2, \ldots,
p_n$ the analyzers of those expressions, the version in the text would
return a procedure roughly equivalent to:

\begin{lstlisting}
(lambda (env)
  (p1 env)
  (p2 env)
  ...
  (pn env))
\end{lstlisting}

On the other hand, Alyssa's version returns a procedure that will loop
explicitly through the list of procedures and apply them
individually.  This is less efficient since the first version use the
native implementation of evaluating a sequence.
