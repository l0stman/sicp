The problem with Louis's implementation is that the first argument to
\lstinline!map! is a procedure in the metacircular evaluator but not
in the underlying scheme implementation.  Thus, if \lstinline!map! is
implemented as a primitive, the interpreter would try to apply an
object which is not a procedure to the first element of the list
argument.  Whereas Eva's implementation don't have this problem.
