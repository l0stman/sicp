The problem with this new version of \lstinline!sqrt-stream! is that
each call to \lstinline!stream-map! creates a fresh stream.  Thus in
order to compute the $n^{th}$ element, we have to call the
\emph{improve} procedure $n-1$ times on the initial guess.  Thus the
running time of the later procedure is $\Theta(n^2)$ instead of
$\Theta(n)$.

For example to compute the third element we have to evaluate:
\begin{lstlisting}
(cons-stream
 1.0
 (cons-stream
  (improve 1.0)
  (cons-stream
   (improve (improve 1.0))
   (stream-map improve
               (stream-map improve
                           (stream-map improve
                                       (sqrt-stream x)))))))
\end{lstlisting}
If we don't memoize the implementation of delay, then there would be
no difference between the two implementations.
