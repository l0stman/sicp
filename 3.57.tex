To compute the $n^{th}$ Fibonacci number, $n-2$ additions are
performed.  If we don't memoize \lstinline!delay!, the number of
additions would be $\Theta(\phi^n)$ where $\phi$ is the golden ratio.
That's because computing \lstinline!fibs! is now equivalent to
computing the naive definition using recursion.
