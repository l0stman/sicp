It happens since the rule is symmetric: if the first person lives near
the second one, the reverse is equally true.  To obtain a list of
people where each pair appears only once, we need to add one more
constraint.  For example, we could impose that the name of
\lstinline!?person-1! comes before \lstinline!?person-2!'s using
lexicographic order.

\begin{lstlisting}
(rule (lives-near ?person-1 ?person-2)
      (and (address ?person-1 (?town . ?rest-1))
           (address ?person-2 (?town . ?rest-2))
           (not (same ?person-1 ?person-2))
           (lisp-value
            (lambda (name1 name2)
              (define (name->string name)
                (if (null? name)
                    ""
                    (string-append
                     (symbol->string (car name))
                     (if (not (null? (cdr name)))
                         " "
                         "")
                     (name->string (cdr name)))))
              (string<? (name->string name1)
                        (name->string name2)))
            ?person-1
            ?person-2)))
\end{lstlisting}
