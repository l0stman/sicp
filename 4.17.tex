There's an extra frame because of the bindings introduced by the
\lstinline!let! form.  Note that when we evaluate the
\lstinline!lambda! form, an new frame is created and no procedure in
the body points directly to this frame.  So there's no difference for
the correctness of the program.

If we want to get rid of the extra frame, we could add to the
variables of the procedure the local bindings.  And transform the
codes that calls the procedures to add \lstinline!*unassigned*!
symbols as extra arguments.
