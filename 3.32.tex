The order must me used because the last action executed from all the
actions in a wire should be the one where all the inputs have their
final values.

Consider an and-gate whose inputs change from $0,1$ to $1,0$ in the
same segment in this order.  The segment' s  procedures in an ordinary
list would be
\begin{lstlisting}
((lambda () (set-signal! output 0))
 (lambda () (set-signal! output 1)))
\end{lstlisting}
which will give an incorrect result.
