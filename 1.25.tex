Given that \lstinline!fast-expt! is $\Theta(\log n)$, this new
version of \lstinline!expmod! is linear to the value of $exp$ in space
an number of steps.

Whereas in the former version of \lstinline!expmod!, we could see by
induction that the first argument of \lstinline!remainder! is less than
$m^2$.  So for a fixed value of $m$, this algorithm is constant in
space and $\Theta(\log exp)$ in number of steps.
