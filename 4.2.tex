\subpar{a}  The problem is that an application is a pair who's not a
special form.  Thus \lstinline!(define x 3)! would be considered an
application in Louis' case, which will cause an error.

\subpar{b}  We just have to redefine some primitives.
\begin{lstlisting}
(define (application? exp) (tagge-list? exp 'call))
(define (operator exp) (cadr exp))
(define (operands exp) (cddr exp))
\end{lstlisting}
\end{document}
