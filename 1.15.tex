a. Using the following function to count the number of times $p$ is
applied:
\begin{lstlisting}
(define (p-count angle)
  (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
      0
      (+ 1 (p-count (/ angle 3.0)))))
\end{lstlisting}
we find that $p$ is applied $5$ times.

\medskip \noindent
b.  Let's note $S(a)$ the space occupied by
the process for an input $a$.  We have,
\[S(a) = S(a/3) + \Theta(1).\]
We then deduce that $S(a) = \Theta(\log a)$. If we suppose that
arithmetic operations are done in constant time, the order of growth
of the number of steps executed is the same as $S(a)$.
