1000000: $P_1$ sets $x$ to $100$ then $P_2$ sets $x$ to $1000000$ and
vice versa.\\
100: $P_1$ accesses $x$ twice, $P_2$ sets $x$ to $1000$, $P_1$ sets
$x$ to $100$.\\
1000 : $P_2$ accesses $x$ thrice, $P_1$ sets $x$ to $100$, $P_2$ sets $x$
to $1000$.\\
10000: $P_2$ sets $x$ to $1000$ between the two times $P_1$ accesses
$x$ or $P_1$ sets $x$ to $100$ between the second and third time $P_2$
accesses $x$. \\
100000: $P_1$ sets $x$ to $100$ between the first and second time  $P_2$
accesses $x$.

With the serialized version the only result is $1000000$.
