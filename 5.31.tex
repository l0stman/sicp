When evaluating \lstinline!(f 'x 'y)!, we don't need to save and
restore the \textbf{env} register when evaluating the operator since
it's a variable nor around the evaluation of each operand since
quotations modify only the val register.  For this last reason, we
don't need to preserve \textbf{proc} and \textbf{argl} respectively
around the evaluation of the operand sequence and each operand.

When evaluating \lstinline!((f) 'x 'y)!, preserving \textbf{proc},
\textbf{env} and \textbf{argl} around respectively the evaluation of
the operand sequence and each operand is unnecessary.

When evaluating \lstinline!(f (g 'x) y)! and
\lstinline!(f (g 'x) 'y)!, preserving \textbf{env} when evaluating the operators
\lstinline!f! and \lstinline!g! are superfluous.  Preserving
\textbf{proc} and \textbf{argl} around the evaluation of the
operand of \lstinline!g! is also unnecessary.  And there's no need to
save and restore \textbf{argl} when evaluating the last argument of
\lstinline!f!.
