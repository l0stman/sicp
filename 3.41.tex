\begin{document}
Suppose Ben and Louis have a shared account.  Suppose that Ben decides
to withdraw from his bank account and Louis ask for the current
balance.  Since these two operations are not serialized, Louis could
obtain an outdated value of the balance.  The problem lies in the
fact that the client could obtain bogus information even if the
balance is always consistent.
