\begin{document}
Suppose that a process $P_1$ exchanges $a_1$ and $a_2$, while $P_2$
exchanges $a_1$ and $a_3$.  The first serializer in the compound
serializer of each process will impeach $P_1$ and $P_2$ to access
$a_1$ at the same time.  On the other hand if $P_2$ tries to swap
$a_2$ and $a_3$.  The second serializer in the compound serializer
will do the same job.  The sum withdrawn from an account will be added
to another one.  Since withdraws and deposits are serialized, when all
the processes terminates, the sum of the balances will be preserved.
